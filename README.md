# DnD Social

DnD Social is a platform for groups that play ‘Pen and Paper’ RPGs with a focus on Dungeons and Dragons. Other similar games can make use of the platform like: Pathfinder, GURPS, Dungeon World etc.

The platform makes it easy and friendly for ‘Game Masters’ to prepare cumbersome parts of preparation. With a few clicks a ‘NPC’ can be generated, edited and saved to your account. This does not stop at single NPCs but the goal is to generate from single npcs to complete villages in one click. This includes a town map, possible region map,some short descriptions, taverns, markets etc.

While playing, the ‘Game Master’ can easily add notes to NPCs, mark them as deceased, retrieve a combat sheet, or hand it out to his/her players. So they have a record of the name, and can add notes as well. In similar ways other things can be added as well that can function as handouts. Like items, puzzles etc. 

There are loads of different generators for different things online for these kind of things. However nowhere you can’t edit and save these things. Manage them and share them with your player. So no more need for 20 different sites, and copy/pasting or saving screenshots.
